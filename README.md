This repository contains a demonstration of Conway's Game of Life. The Pyglet python library is the only required dependency and can easily be installed via pip. After installing Pyglet the demo can be run by using the Python interpreter to run the game_of_life.py file.

python3 game_of_life.py

Optionally a grid size can be passed at the command line:

python3 game_of_life.py grid_size
